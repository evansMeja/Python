## Python Is Awesome

Python is a cross-platform programming language, meaning, it runs on multiple platforms like Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Unix and has even been ported to the Java and .NET virtual machines. It is free and open source

### Now there are various ways to start Python.

1. Immediate mode
2. Script Mode

# 1. Immediate mode
Typing python in the command line will invoke the interpreter in immediate mode. We can directly type in Python expressions and press enter to get the output.

```>>>

```

# 2. Script mode
This mode is used to execute Python program written in a file. Such a file is called a script. Scripts can be saved to disk for future use. Python scripts have the extension .py, meaning that the filename ends with .py.
For example: helloWorld.py

To execute this file in script mode we simply write ***python helloWorld.py*** at the command prompt.
